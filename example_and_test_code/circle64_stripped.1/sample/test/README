README

This sample displays a fractal image from a Mandelbrot set. It may be build for single- or multi-core. Before building you should set the DEPTH define in include/circle/screen.h to 16 to increase the number of available colors. Furthermore you should set "loglevel=1" in the file cmdline.txt on the SD card. Otherwise some logging messages may be generated which will overwrite the image.

This sample was chosen because it is well suited to demonstrate the performance gain of a multi-core architecture. Using a single core the whole image is calculated by core 0. With multi-core support each of the four available cores calculates a quarter of the fractal image which is much faster.

If you want to run this sample with multiple cores you have to define ARM_ALLOW_MULTI_CORE in include/circle/sysconfig.h.
